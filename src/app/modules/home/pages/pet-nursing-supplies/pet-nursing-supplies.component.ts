The pill falls out before I can maneuver my hand and fingers to shoot it from the device. Judging by other reviews I think it may be me, not the device but the only one having trouble. I have had one successful pulling adventure (yay!) but several unsuccessful attempts accompanied by loads of cat drool. If I can get the hang of this it should be good for 2 of our 4 cats. The two who will benefit from the quick pulling as easy going and allow for the learning curve and some cats just won't be pilled without a battle lol.",
