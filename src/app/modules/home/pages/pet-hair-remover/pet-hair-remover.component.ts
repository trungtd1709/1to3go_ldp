Chom Chom roller is a different design/mechanism than the original, so I was skeptical. This little guy is the same design and works great. While the animal design is cute, I do wish it was a little more compact for travel.',

I have bought different style that works on couch but not too well on clothes I'm wearing. But the way this one is made makes it so much easier to use on yourself. I love it would definitely buy again.",

I use it on furniture and clothes. Hair collects in the compartment just fine. Simple to empty and keep clean. I love it. Am considering about ordering a second one. I would like to have a travel sized one to keep in my car.',
